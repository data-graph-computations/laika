% We investigate the problem of executing physical simulations 
% efficiently on a cluster of computers. We cast the problem 
% as a data-graph computation in the style of GraphLab, where 
% vertices represent points in a physical mesh and edges connect 
% nearby vertices. Taking advantage of the special properties 
% of mesh graphs, including the locality of edges, we devise 
% and evaluate schemes for partioning such graphs across a 
% cluster of computers to minimize communication and for 
% performing vertex updates on individual machines with high 
% cache locality and parallelism.
We investigate the problem of implementing the physical simulations
specified in the domain-specific language Simit as a \defn{data-graph
computation}.
\emph{Data-graph computations} consist of a graph $G=(V,E)$, where
each vertex has data associated with it, and an update function 
which is applied to each vertex, taking as inputs the neighboring 
vertices.  \proc{Prism} is a framework for executing data-graph
computations in shared memory using a scheduling technique called 
\emph{chromatic scheduling}, where a coloring of the input graph
is used to parcel out batches of independent work, sets of 
vertices with a common color, while preserving
determinism.  An alternative scheduling approach is \emph{priority-dag
scheduling} where a priority function $\rho$ mapping each vertex $v \in V$
to a real number is used to orient the edges from low to high priority and
and thus generate a dag.  We propose to extend \proc{Prism} in two primary
ways.  First, we will extend it to use distributed memory to enable
problem sizes many orders of magnitude larger than the current 
implementation using a graph partitioning approach which minimizes
the number of edges that cross distributed memory nodes.  
Second, we will replace the chromatic scheduler in
\proc{Prism} with a priority-dag scheduler and a priority function 
which generates a cache-efficient traversal of the vertices when the
input graph is locally connected and embeddable in a low-dimensional 
space.  This subset of graphs is important for the physical simulations
generated by the language Simit.
